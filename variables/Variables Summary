In research, variables represent elements that can change or take on different values. Understanding variables is crucial, especially in quantitative research, as they help explain relationships within the study. Variables can be categorized in several ways: Independent vs. dependent, active vs. attribute, continuous, discrete, and categorical, among others. Some variables, like age or gender, cannot be manipulated, while others, such as anxiety levels, can be modified within a study.

Key Points:
Definition of Variables:

A variable is something that can change or have more than one value. It includes demographic, physical, or social properties like weight, height, income, and occupation.
Independent and Dependent Variables:

Independent Variable: The variable that is manipulated or is the cause in an experiment.
Dependent Variable: The variable that is affected by the independent variable.
Types of Variables:

Active Variables: Can be manipulated (e.g., anxiety levels in a pain reduction study).
Attribute Variables: Cannot be manipulated (e.g., age, gender).
Continuous Variables: Can take infinite values within a range (e.g., weight).
Discrete Variables: Take specific, finite values (e.g., number of children).
Categorical Variables: Defined by categories (e.g., gender) and can be dichotomous (two categories like male/female) or trichotomous (three categories like urban, semi-urban, rural).
Extraneous Variables:

Variables that affect research outcomes but are not accounted for or controlled. If these influence the study unexpectedly, they can confound results.
Demographic Variables:

Characteristics such as age, gender, and occupation that describe the research sample but cannot be manipulated. They are useful for determining the representativeness of the sample.
Measuring Variables:

Variables need to be quantified for analysis, often using different scales:
Nominal Scale: Categorizes variables without ranking (e.g., blood type).
Ordinal Scale: Ranks variables (e.g., levels of pain: mild, moderate, severe).
Interval Scale: Measures equal numerical intervals between variables.
Ratio Scale: Similar to the interval scale but with a true zero point, allowing for the ranking and comparison of variables.

### Summary
The text discusses the importance of defining and identifying variables in quantitative research. Variables, which can change and have multiple values, are fundamental to research, impacting the study's complexity and statistical analysis. Types of variables include independent, dependent, active, attribute, continuous, discrete, and categorical. Understanding how these variables interact is crucial for researchers to draw accurate conclusions.
